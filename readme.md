# Employee Directory App
This is a employee directory search application built with Angular2, TypeScript, and Gulp.js. 

## Project Structure
* This project does not utilize Angular Quickstart or CLI and is managed using Gulp.js. 
* The app's main core app component can be found in the process folder. There you will find the app.component.ts file where the current employee data is hardcoded. To pull in data via REST API, you can create a data service to consume data via the REST API by creating an Angular2 http module. 
* Within the builds folder you will find your development folders, file partials, and image assets.
